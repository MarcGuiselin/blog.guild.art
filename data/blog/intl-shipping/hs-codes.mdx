Whenever you ship something internationally the package will be handed over to Customs before entering the country. To inform the Customs inspector of what is inside the parcel (what it is and how it should be taxed), you include Harmonized System (HS) Codes. You can find codes for your products here: https://www.tariffnumber.com/

Most shipping companies will have default customs documents for you to use, which will have a field for the HS code. All you have to do is fill it out!

<Tailor.Form>
  <Tailor.Dropdown
    name="is_toylike"
    label="Are you shipping something that might be considered a toy? (doll, plush, figurine, etc)"
    options={{
      '': "I'm not sure",
      yes: 'Yes',
      no: 'No',
    }}
  />
  <Tailor.Show if={(get) => get('is_toylike') == 'yes' || get('is_toy')}>
    <Tailor.Dropdown
      name="is_toy"
      label="Is it a toy intended for children?"
      options={{
        '': "I'm not sure",
        yes: {
          title: 'Yes',
          description:
            'The item I am shipping is designed or intended, whether or not exclusively, for use in play by children under 14 years of age.',
        },
        no: {
          title: 'No',
          description: 'This is not a toy',
        },
      }}
    />
  </Tailor.Show>
</Tailor.Form>
