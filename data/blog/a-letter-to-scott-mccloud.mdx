**TLDR:** I'd like your help designing and perhaps one day co-patenting what you coined the [infinite canvas](https://www.scottmccloud.com/4-inventions/canvas/index.html).
I'm working on the tech that makes that possible right now. A 3d navigation engine called *Harmony*.

I'm a goofball, but this is actually a serious request. Please read.

This letter includes several exerpts from Scott McCloud's graphic Novel "Reinventing Comics: Evolution of an art form." Please support him by following his [socials](https://twitter.com/scottmccloud) and purchasing his excellent work available in stores, both physical and digital, worldwide! üòÅ

## Do I know you?

I'm Marc, a 23 yo Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with a specialization in business and accounting.
I have experience working on technologies like computer-vision, robotics, augmented reality, medical privacy-compliant software and more.
In my spare time I'm an accessibility-focused web developer that maintains two open-source browser extensions used by nearly a million people all over the globe.

A while back I got in touch with the very nice Kristi, the person spearheading the hurculean [Etsy strike](https://etsystrike.org/). I shared some details about the project I've been working on (more about this later) and in the following weeks she excitedly pointed people towards my cause. This led me to meeting Thomas, another programmer, who himself is very interested in comics and a big fan of yours. When describing my project, he asked me "Have you heard of Scott McCloud?;" one thing led to another and I purchased your graphic novel "Reinventing comics."

## What I'm working on

I've been working 8 months on starting a cooperative between professional artists called *"The Guild of Artists."* (a bit cheesy, I know üòÖ)
We're building a inclusive, safe, open, artist-owned marketplace to share and sell artwork.
We hope to become a bastion dedicated to protecting artist, worker and creator rights.
I've been working on building the technical infrastructure that makes it possible.

First versions of the marketplace were very boring webpages. The designs got a mixed response from our small community long before they went live. I wasn't happy with the restrictions the designs enforced, so I set up to build a sort of virtual sandbox where artists build galleries in a 3d top-down video-game like world.

## Re-Reinventing Comics

One of the earliest requests from the artists I came in communication with was to remove creative restrictions. Traditionally all websites force you to upload art in limitting ways; including in limiting layouts, numbers, formats etc.

I was speaking to artists who shared different photographs of their artwork online, and often wanted to share video, descriptions, tutorials, etc together. However all internet platforms force you to separate your artwork into several different disjoint pieces.

*"But hey, is that a problem?"* Scott then asks. I think so. Our artists seem to think so too. See these posts taken from our general chat thread on discord:

Easy, no problem... or so I thought. This choice led me to completely re-think how I was going to get this show on the road.

Over two decades ago, you had in many ways envisioned the future I was trying to build. Your comic challenged me to re-approach the problems I've been dealing with building this tech.

For example, a big issue building apps is incompatibility between screen sizes and navigation methods.

Most websites spread out content on wider-screened desktops. If this same layout was used on smartphones, users would have to awkwardly scroll side-to-side to reveal hidden content on the left and right sides of the screen, when most apps only scroll up/down. To solve this issue, layouts are resized on mobile screens so content shows itself in a single column that fits within the width of the screen.

Unfortunately this is one of several issues with the "infinite canvas." If I give artists a sandbox where they can place artwork in places where they might be hidden on smaller screens, it will result in very mixed experiences for people browsing these spaces on different devices.

However, I realized that taking inspiration from the comic medium, this infinite 3d gallery can be sub-sectioned into pages, that are themselves sub-sectioned into comic panels. Rather than separating these, they exist together in 3d space, and the viewer's perspective is altered so their viewing experience of the artwork can be maximized on whatever size screen they are using.

![Exerpt from a comic by Scott McCloud that reads "Most important, the ability of creators to subdivide their work as before is undiminished, but now the page (what Will Eisner calls the meta-panel) can take whatever size and shape a given scene warrants, no matter how strange"](/static/images/blog/reinventing-comics-by-scott-mccloud/p227-2.jpg)

On larger devices, entire pages would be shown at once and on smaller screens the content would be zoomed in on individual panels.

## The larger picture

The web is inspired by print. However, as it progressed, the web has started to morph into the third dimension, the z-axis. Built on top of the technologies of the current era, I envision a free-to-roam artist-created 3d world built on top of flat rectangular comic pages with interactible elements. Imagine 3d models that "pop out" from the page, or pages rotated in 3d space

</Copyright>

The Guild of Artists marketplace would be a catalogue of comics, each made of an infinite number of pages from which customers could purchase readymade artwork, commission artists, and more. Pages could be connected to others using dimension-warping portals, allowing a fluid experience for visitors to travel in the z-axis from one comic to another. Artists could share what they are working on by publishing comics and updating them over time, sending new page/panel updates directly to their fans.

My hope is that in the future we start to repair the damage created by large corperations: think the harmful delivery/response times marketplaces like amazon/etsy place on artists or the unsustainable expectation for artists on twitter/tiktok/youtube to stay relevant with viral trends. Comics could replace twitter feeds for sharing artwork, and portals could replace retweets allowing artists to share each other's work and promote social causes important to them!

Watch my recorded video below for more details, or visit the [whats.guild.art](https://whats.guild.art) for access to a 3d presentation that demonstrates and explains how the marketplace will work.

## Why I need your help, Scott

Firstly, I need a partner that shares this vision; someone who can bring it to life with their artwork. I want someone who's willing to explore the extent of what is possible; who's work and feedback will be a critical as mine in determining the look and feel of the final system. Scott is a veteran of the comics industry, and it'd be a dream to work with him in order to make this a reality.

Secondly, a mild fear of mine is that this gains traction and our technology gets copied by a large corp. I want what I'm making to be a tool exclusive for professional artists within our network. The goal of a co-patent would be to retain legal rights to this technology and keep it out of the hands of those who would use it for personal gain. The last thing I would want is for some shoddy NFT marketplace to start selling digital comic book panels, or a pro-consumerism marketplace to start selling low-value, high-waste products using our tech.

Thirdly, I need a bit of an art spokeperson. I'm happy to do the talking, but when it comes down to illustrating the concepts I have in my head, it only comes out as scribbles that make children's artwork look like masterpieces. So what I need is someone to show our audience what's in the making, and then show what's possible once it becomes usable.

Fundamentally, The Guild of Artists is designed not to generate profit- rather it's designed to keep itself afloat within a large enough margin to guarantee it's services be provided to artists. It has no provisions for paying staff and developers. We'll be relying on crowd-sourced funding from our artist community, and that relies on traction and usership. Our goal will be to eventually to create a sustainable business where the marketplace directly address the needs of artists and artists directly fund ongoing development and moderation.

Contact me back and we can set up a meeting time. I'm very friendly... or so people tell me ü§î

## I'll take what I can get

Ultimately I understand that what I'm asking for may be a lot, so I'll take whatever help or feedback you're willing to give me if any at all. Your reputation precedes you after all, and you undoubtedly lead a busy life. I don't expect a response. It was worth a shot.

Regardless of what you choose, this is my life now, I'll see this to the end. Maybe I'll file a patent on my own once i scrounge up the funds.

This goes to anyone reading this, regardless of who you are. If you see any value in what I'm trying to build, please become a part of it.
