NFT marketplaces make it very difficult to take down stolen art. Because of your reputation, there's only so much most people can do to take down their stolen artwork. They often require sensitive personal details to verify your identity and these details are shared with the art thief. **Please, do not submit your personal information this way as it can put you at risk of identity theft!**

Although your art is stolen and placed on these marketplaces, it often hasn't been converted into an NFT yet (since this is expensive). You often have a chance to take the art down before it is purchased.

Instead, there are safer methods for taking down stolen artwork and I have listed them below. Thanks to [@CalpainEqD](https://twitter.com/CalpainEqD) for the research! I took much inspiration from his blogpost about the same subject.

If you find new methods, or if one doesn't work for you, tag our socials [@guildofartists](https://twitter.com/guildofartists) and we'll edit this blogpost and try to help you out.

Only the legal copyright owner of the artwork can report it as being stolen. There can be severe liability for damages if you misrepresent a copyright claim.

The NFT listing will remain, but the image will be removed.

1. Find your artwork on OpenSea
2. Right click (or long press the image) and “copy the image address”
3. Visit https://support.google.com/legal/contact/lr_dmca?product=googlecloudstorage
4. Fill in your personal details (these won't be shared with the art thief)
5. Add the link you copied to the “Allegedly infringing URLs” field, as shown below. Your url must contain “googleusercontent.com” for google to take it down!
