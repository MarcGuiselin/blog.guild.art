‚ÄúThe Guild of Artists,‚Äù often shortened to ‚ÄúGuild Artists,‚Äù is a diverse, inclusive network of artists creating and selling handmade artpieces online. Run by the artists themselves, we offer a safe platform for self-promotion, interacting with your customers and ensuring a smooth commissioning process.

# We're a Cooperative

Our platform is fully democratically governed <img className="emoji" draggable="false" alt="‚úåÔ∏è" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/270c.svg"/> by all member artists and transparently operated by administrators. By joining us you get to be a part of the decision-making process for where to take the entire platform! New features and rules are decided by you.

If this sounds exciting, don't hesitate to reach out. We'd love to hear from fellow artists!

# Your New Workspace

At the core of our platform are Art Galleries: dynamic, rich and fully customizable portfolios. These galleries make it easy for your customers to find you based on their interests. You could, for example, make your pricelist easily accessible alongside your artworks. Give the option for customers to commission similar items or buy readymade items directly from your gallery. Review your analytics and decide to ‚Äúpin‚Äù your most iconic artwork to be listed first in your gallery. Notify customers of policy changes. Cross-promote with other artists and do so much more!

Creating an account on Guild.art will allow customers access to artist commission queues, waitlists, quotes, shops, purchase items in gallery, and receive notifications of artist activity. Top-of-the-line identity verification, spam, chargeback protection and buyer reputation systems allow you to better trust your customers. <img className="emoji" draggable="false" alt="ü§ù" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/13.1.0/svg/1f91d.svg"/>
