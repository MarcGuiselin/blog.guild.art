title: Guild Artists Privacy Policy
summary: "In four words: We don't track you"
---

Here, at The Guild of Artists, our commitment to privacy is very simple: **We don't track you!**

We don't use cookies to track you; in fact, until you create an account, we have no way to personally identify visitors on our website!

When you submit personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") it is only shared with the people that need to see it. For example, when you make a purchase on https://guild.art, your info stays private between you and the artist you purchased from (unless you break our terms of service).

## 1. Do Not Track

We respect your choice not to be tracked by default. [More about DNT.](https://allaboutdnt.com/)

## 2. Definitions

- Our **website** means the https://guild.art website and all subdomains
- **Cookies** are pieces of data stored on the device you use to visit our website
- **Community members** are the people that operate the website. This includes independent artists, site moderators and developers

## 3. Use of Cookies

We do not use cookies to track you.

We use cookies to keep users signed in and for account-related security purposes.

We use cookies to enable the customization features listed below: (These choices are private and are not shared with anyone else)

- Site theme choice (dark or light theme)
- Helpful features and tools in our blog posts (such as the dropdown choices in some articles)

## 4. Social Widgets

We don't use any social widgets, since these can be used to track you. Instead, we pull information from social media networks like Twitter and show our own look-alike embedded tweets.

## 5. How we Track Activity on our Website, Without Tracking you

We use privacy-first, self-hosted tools (including [Umami](https://umami.is/)) to collect aggregate, anonymized activity data such as the following:

- How many views a blog post has received
- How long on average people read our blog posts
- How many people have interacted with a tool in a blog post

All community members have access to this data so we can improve our website together and make it more useful to you.

- This data cannot be traced back to any individual user
- This data is not shared with or sold to third parties

## 6. Data we collect from account holders

Our website wouldn't work if no artist could know who their customers are! So we collect information to enable our shops and other services. We also collect information in order to create a safe environment for both you and our community members.

Once you create an account, you will provide us with some personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") about yourself such as your nickname, email address and personal pronouns in order for us to contact you and identify you on our website. In addition, we automatically collect usage-related information.

You may also choose to sign-up or sign-in using a third-party service such as Facebook, Google or Discord. In these cases, we will ask for permission to collect basic information such as your name, email address and profile picture.

You may need to submit additional information to us in order to enable you to use certain features (such as making purchases) on our website. This includes but is not limited to: your name, email address, phone number, personal home address, payment and transaction data.

We may also use this information for the safety/moderation of our community. See [6.6. Data Access by Community Members](#66-data-access-by-community-members) for more information.

### 6.1. Your information is not for sale

We never have and never will share your Personal Information to third parties without your explicit permission.

### 6.2. Purchase/transaction data

When you make a purchase on our website, we collect your transaction data including your date of purchase, billing/shipping address, details about the item purchased and more.

Information about your transaction will remain private between you and the artist you purchased from, unless the artist suspects fraud or other malicious activity that would be a violation of our terms of service.

Purchase details, such as credit card information, is processed and handled by our payment service provider, Adyen (read their privacy policy [here](https://www.adyen.com/policies-and-disclaimer/privacy-policy)). We do not store, transmit, or have access to sensitive payment information.

### 6.3. Usage data

We automatically collect information as a signed-in user navigates and interacts with our website. We collect this data mostly to fight spam and fraud. This includes:

Usage-related information - We may track data such as the pages you visit, the time you spend on our website and interactions with artwork. Some of this data is aggregated, anonymized and shared with our community members in order for them to make informed decisions about the artwork and other content they publish on our website.

Information about your device - such as your IP address, operating system, browser type, browser version and device ID. This data is not shared with any third parties and is used only to provide account protection, as well as the safety/moderation of our community.

### 6.4. My data rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to request access to your personal information and to have it corrected, updated or deleted.

Please [contact us](#contact-us) and we'll gladly help out.

If you are an EU citizen, please refer to the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) for a comprehensive list of your rights.

If you are a California resident, please refer to the [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) for a comprehensive list of your rights.

### 6.5. Retention

For legal reasons, after a purchase is made on our website, we store transaction data for a retention period of 10 years to comply with the law.

The rest of our data is retained for a limited period of time. We don't hoard data or keep it longer than we need to in order to provide our services.

Note that we may retain your personal information for longer if we believe it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or enforce our agreements.

### 6.6. Data Access by Community Members

We have strict rules for how and when your personal information is accessed internally by community members. These rules are listed below:

User account information may only be accessed only in order to:

- Fulfill an order (ship an item)
- Examine/close a dispute
- Respond to a user's request (such as closing an account)
- Check for illegal activity, spam or fraud (in good faith)

Furthermore, when an account holder breaks our terms of service (or is suspected of doing so in good faith), any of the information they have submitted (excluding payment details) or personal information that was automatically collected, might be privately shared with moderators or community members in order to make decisions about the account in question.

Community members are under an obligation of confidentiality. This means they may not share another person's personal information with anyone outside of the community or any third party.

## 7. Data we collect from community members

The community that moderates and develops the website is most active on Discord (you must accept [Discord's privacy policy](https://discord.com/privacy) when you create a Discord account).

As a community member, privacy rules with regards to the information you submit as a user of the website are the same as any other user. Your personal information will remain private by default unless one of the rules listed under [6.6. Data Access by Community Members](#66-data-access-by-community-members) applies.

For example: your personal information would be shared with another community member if you made a purchase from them on our website.

## 8. Children

All children under the age of 13 in the United States, or otherwise minors in the jurisdiction in which they reside, are not allowed to use our website.

If we suspect the user of an account is under the age of 13, we will immediately close the account in question and delete personal data pertaining to the account.
